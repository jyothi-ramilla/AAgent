# Project Overview

This project consists of two main codebases: **Token_Contract** and **Agent**. The purpose of this project is to deploy an ERC20 smart contract and integrate it with an agent to solve the problem statement.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Docker**: Used to containerize the entire codebase and manage dependencies.
- **Bash**: Used to execute setup scripts and automate the process.

## Codebases

### Token_Contract

This codebase contains the deployed **ERC20 smart contract**. It is responsible for defining the token's functionalities such as transferring tokens, checking balances, etc.

For more details on how to deploy or modify the contract, refer to the README file inside the `Token_Contract` folder.

### Agent

The **Agent** codebase contains the full implementation of the problem statement. It integrates with the deployed ERC20 smart contract to interact with it and fulfill the requirements.

For more details on how the agent works, refer to the README file inside the `Agent` folder.

## Setup and Execution

1. **Clone the repository**:
   main branch is the upto date branch.Clone from main branch
